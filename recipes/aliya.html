        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Aliya is basically smoked meat, a dish popular with communities in East Africa and specifically
            the luo tribe of Kenya. The meat is usually sun dried as a way to preserve it, to be cooked later.
            Most people preffer to use either beef, lamb or mutton in its preparation.However, You can use any kind of meat.
        </p>
         <p>Aliya can be taken with Ugali, rice, matoke, bread, yams etc. making it really fun,
             I mean what with all that choice of accompaniment!! and interestingly, the more the meat 
             stays in the preservation state, the more tastier it gets when cooked.
