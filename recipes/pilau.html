        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pilau is a delicacy found in Eastern Africa and some parts of Asia.
           It is made up of rice, 
           goat meat and several spices depending on the region where the pilau is cooked. 
           The meat does not necessarily have to be goat, any kind of meat can be used.
        </p>
        <p>The meal is often accompanied by 'Kachumbari' a salad comprising tomatoes, onions, chilli etc.
           It is a meal that is favoured during times of festivities, and especially weddings 
           in parts of Eastern Africa.
